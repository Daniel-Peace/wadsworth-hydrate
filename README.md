# Wadsworth Hydrate

---

## What is it?
This is a simple bot with one command that allows you to remind your friends to stay hydrated.

---

## Main goals for project:
The idea was to create a super trivial bot in hopes of learning core concepts to aid in future bots. These concepts included:
- Create a discord bot using TS
- Deploy a program in a Docker container on a Raspberry PI

---

## How to use it?
This bot only has one command

```
/hydrate
```
which causes Wadsworth to send the reminder message.
